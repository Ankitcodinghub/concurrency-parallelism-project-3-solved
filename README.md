1 Introduction

The ‚ÄúMonte Carlo Method‚Äù is a method of solving problems using sta- tistics. Given the probability, p, that an event will occur in certain conditions, a computer can be used to generate those conditions repea- tedly. The number of times the event occurs divided by the number of times the conditions are generated should be approximately equal to p.

Figure 1 shows a circle with radius r = 1 inscribed within a square.

The area of the circle is œÄr2 = œÄ12 = œÄ, and the area of the square is

(2r)2 = 22 = 4. The ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the

square is p = Area of circle = œÄ = 0.7853981634 Area of square 4

If we could compute ratio p, then we could multiple it by four to

obtain the value œÄ = p √ó 4. One particularly simple way to do this is

to pick lattice points in the square and count how many of them lie inside the circle (see

Figure2). Suppose for example that the points Ùè∞ã 2i‚àí1 , 2j‚àí1 Ùè∞å32, 32 are selected, then there 32 32 i=1,j=1

are 812 points inside the circle and 212 points outside the circle and the percentage of points inside the circle is p = 812 = 812 = 0.792195122. Then the area of the circle is

approximated with the following calculation: Area of circle = p√óArea of square = p√ó4 = 0.792195122 √ó 4 = 3, 168780488.

2 Monte Carlo Method for œÄ

Monte Carlo methods can be thought of as statistical simulation

methods that utilize a sequences of random numbers to perform the

simulation. The name ‚ÄúMonte Carlo‚Äù was coined by Nicholas Cons- Figura 2: Ratio tantine Metropolis (1915-1999) and inspired by Stanslaw Ulam (1909- between areas of 1986), because of the similarity of statistical simulation to games of circle and square.

chance, and because Monte Carlo is a center for gambling and games

of chance. In a typical process one compute the number of points in a set A that lies inside box R. The ratio of the number of points that fall inside A to the total number of points tried is equal to the ratio of the two areas (or volume in 3 dimensions). The accuracy of the ratio p depends on the number of points used, with more points leading to a more accurate value.

A simple Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the value of œÄ

could involve randomly selecting points (xi,yi)ni=1 in the unit square

and determining the ratio p = mn where m is number of points that

satisfy x2i + yi2 ‚â§ 1. In a typical simulation of sample size n = 1000

there are 787 points satisfying that equation. Using this data we obtain

p=m = 787 =0.787andœÄ=p√ó4=0.787√ó4=3.148. n 1000

Every time a Monte Carlo simulation is made using the same sam- ple size n it will come up with a slightly different value. The values converge very slowly of the order O(n‚àí1/2). This property is a conse- quence of the Central Limit Theorem.

You may find a web simulation of this method at https:// academo.org/demos/estimating-pi-monte-carlo/.

3 Lab Work

3.1 Study OpenMP

Start by studying OpenMP (https://www.openmp.org/resources/tutorials-articles/). I recommend you to study these slides

https://www.openmp.org/wp-content/uploads/omp-hands-on-SC08.pdf

up to page 20 and and try the proposed exercises (up to page 20). You may also follow this tutorial in youtube

<pre>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLX-Q6B8xqZ8n8bwjGdzBJ25X2utwnoEG
</pre>
and/or study this book

<pre>https://libgen.lc/ads.php?md5=D27D7EE55FA748118FEA185BC27D6FB5
</pre>
Then step into the next section of this lab protocol.

3.2 OpenMP Parallel Version

Depart from the sequential version that you developed for the Lab of last week (P2). Now, use OpenMP to parallelize your program developing two versions:

1. An OpenMP parallel version that has as few changes to the sequential version as possible; and

2. An OpenMP parallel version that is optimized for speed. 2

The parallel program(s) must receive as command line arguments the number of simu- lations to be executed (i.e., the number of points to be generated) and how many parallel threads shall be executing. The second command line argument shall be optional and default to one.

Remember to keep on using GIT. üôÇ

3.3 Experimental evaluation

Use the same command line flag that you use in the plain C version to make the program produce a simplified (CSV-like) output.

Reuse the bash script from last week to run multiple tests in your computer, with different values for iterations and processors. Also, remember to run each configuration at least three times.

3.4 To Think About. . .

The sequential version is faster, slower or identical to the parallel version with just one thread?

The parallel version with two thread is faster than with one? When you double the number of threads does it take half the time? More? Less?

Which of your implementations is faster? Java? C + pThreads? C + OpenMP? Why?

Final Note

If you search the web, it will be trivial to find an implementation of the Monte Carlo simulation to approximate the value of œÄ, that you can easily adapt to your needs. But note that if you do that, you are cheating and you will not learn what you are supposed to learn in this lab class. Just be honest to yourself and make your own program. üòâ
